GRAPH STRUCTURE

● A GRAPH consists of
a finite set of
vertices or nodes and
a set of edges
connecting these
vertices.
● Two vertices are said
to be adjacent if they
are connected to
each other by the
same edge..

GLOSSARY

● These are key
definitions that
we need to
know in relation
to GRAPHs

● Order: The number of vertices in the graph
● Size: The number of edges in the graph
● Vertex degree: The number of edges that are incident to a vertex
● Isolated vertex: A vertex that is not connected to any other vertices in the graph
● Self-loop: An edge from a vertex to itself
● Directed graph: A graph where all the edges have a direction indicating what is the
start vertex and what is the end vertex
● Undirected graph: A graph with edges that have no direction
● Weighted graph: Edges of the graph has weights
● Unweighted graph: Edges of the graph has no weights
● Graph cycle: a cycle occurs when three or more vertices in the graph are
connected so as to form a closed loop
● Acyclic graph: a graph that has no cycles
● Cyclic graph: a graph that has at least one cycle
● Connected graph: graph is connected if for every pair of vertices in the graph
there is a path of one or more edges connecting the given vertices.

BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH

EXAMPLES

● Used to determine
the shortest paths
and minimum
spanning trees.
● Used to search on
social networks.

BFS

Starts at a particular
vertex and explore all of its
neighbours at the present
depth before moving on to
the vertices in the next
level.

DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH

EXAMPLES

● Used to find a path
between two
vertices.
● Used to detect
cycles in a graph.
● Used in topological
sorting.
● Used to solve
puzzles having only
one solution (e.g.,
mazes)

DFS

Starts from a particular
vertex and explore as far
as possible along each
branch before retracing
back (backtracking).

SHORTEST PATH

EXAMPLES

● Used to find
directions to travel
from one location to
another in mapping
software like Google
maps or Apple
maps.
● Used in networking
to solve the
min-delay path
problem.

SHORTEST PATH

The shortest path from
one vertex to another
vertex is a path in the
graph such that the sum
of the weights of the
edges that should be
travelled is minimum.
(Dijkstra’s shortest path
algorithm, Bellman–Ford
algorithm)

CYCLE DETECTION

EXAMPLES

● Used in distributed
message-based
algorithms.
● Used to detect
deadlocks in
concurrent systems.

CYCLE

Path in a graph where the
first and last vertices are
the same. If we start from
one vertex, travel along a
path and end up at the
starting vertex, then this
path is a cycle.
