Mounting
Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.
React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:
constructor()
getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()
The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.

componentDidMount
The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.
This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.
componentDidUpdate
The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.
The example below might seem complicated, but all it does is this:
When the component is mounting it is rendered with the favorite color "red".
When the component has been mounted, a timer changes the state, and the color becomes "yellow".
This action triggers the update phase, and since this component has a componentDidUpdate method, this method is executed and writes a message in the empty DIV element:
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevStates, snapshot)
