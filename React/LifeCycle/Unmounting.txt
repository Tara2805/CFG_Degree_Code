Unmounting
The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.
React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:
componentWillUnmount()
componentWillUnmount
The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.
This is the best place to call any clean-up operations! For example if you had started any timers, make sure to stop them in here! Or cancelling any pending network requests that youâ€™re still waiting on.
